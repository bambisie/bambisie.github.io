Hey, chicos and chicas!  My name is Tammy and I want to be a vet. 


I graduated from the University of Southampton with a BSc Honours Zoology (1:1) degree in 2020 and I am currently applying to different Vet Schools in a number of European countries. 

My blog I going to give you a glimpse of a mature student's life trying to make it in to vet school. 
Fingers crossed that I can manage to secure a place so that in the future you can read about my expiriences of my non-traditional vet student journey. 

Feel free to contact me if you are looking to apply abroad - I have done me research :)
